Relay Computer 2

* Brainfuck arch with RLE support

* 16-bit address - Use SRAM IC;

* 16-bit IP;

* 8-bit Data;

* 8-stage while loop stack;

* Use reed switch relay only;

* Main logic takes 1800 relays, and we need about 200 relays for control signal routing

* Clock frequency 40-50Hz.

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, and notable for its extreme minimalism.

The language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer. While it is fully Turing-complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers.

The language's name is a reference to the slang term brainfuck, which refers to things so complicated or unusual that they exceed the limits of one's understanding.

Classic Brainfuck arch has eight commands:

* \>	increment the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the right).

* <	decrement the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the left).

* \+	increment (increase by one) the byte at the data pointer.

* \-	decrement (decrease by one) the byte at the data pointer.

* .	output the byte at the data pointer.

* ,	accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer.

* [	if the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching ] command.

* ]	if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching [ command.

As each relay has very big latency I add RLE compressing of +- and <> commands.

If source file contain "+++++" or "-----" sequence, when listing will be loaded this sequence will be transformed into "+Constant" command - My computer has fully - functional 8-bit ADD-er for Data and 16-bit Adder for Address and this hack improve computer performance in many times.

Use DipTrace 2.3 or higher  to open project files

Use Splan 7 to open spl7 files - there are some structures.
